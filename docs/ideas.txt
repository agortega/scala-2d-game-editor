Entrance to hell:
The cemetery is located below a road. It appears to be very old and seems deserted. Few stairs along the road can be used to descend to the cemetery level. There are paintings along the cemetery wall which supports the road - they serve to hide entrances to crypts. Most paintings are disturbing - they depict unusual creatures and weird scenery, often involving scenes of violence. 
One particular crypt entrance is covered with a painting of some sort of small hairy human-like creature with clawed feet standing in front of a hill below a yellow sky. The creature appears to be staring directly into the floor in front of the wall.
Few people have gone to the cemetery at night. Fewer still have noticed that between 11 o'clock and midnight the creature is not actually present on the painting. Coming closer reveals that it is in fact in front of the painting, standing very, very still. It remains unclear whether it is an inanimate statue or an actual fiend standing in the dark.
This scene alone was enough to drive away all those who were ever close to the painting at this hour. None of them ever knew that if they tried to step into the hill scene behind the creature, they would find themselves inside the crypt, filled with dozens of similar motionless statues. For inside of that crypt, there are stairs leading lower to similar crypts, on and on, until finally reaching hell itself.
If anybody ever entered and not leaved before midnight, he would find himself having to spend a day inside.
