Defeat

When you are truly defeated,
better it is to accept and walk away.
There is glory in defeat too,
There is valour in how you fought,
And greatness in how you stayed who you are.

It does not matter what could have been done,
It does not matter what is right and wrong,
It makes no sense to defy what was meant to be.

It takes wisdom to know how to accept,
that there is glory in defeat as well.
