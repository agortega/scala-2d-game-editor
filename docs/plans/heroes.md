## Great Count Gerald
The count who came to rulership some 40 years ago, now deceased but respected among the people. He restored law and order, and repaired the economy, leaving little trace of the Avalanche that striked these lands. He raised the status of women in the society, convinced the wizard guilds to accept female apprentices more often and even started knighting female soldiers. He was replaced in old age in weird circumstances - some believed he was poisoned as part of a plot. These assumptions were quickly discarded by his heir.

## Undril
A hermit mage that lived in the mountains far north.

## Kariim
A legendary wizard from the south that formed the wizard's guild and defied the warrior caste.

## Rhea
A wizardess from the time of Great Count Gerald. She was a brilliant illusionist and many illusion spells carry her name. Many say she was enlightened. She disappeared from the lands soon after Great Count Gerald's death.

## Ganilot
A talented wizard who fleed the lands after tricking his king for the good of the country. This was long ago.
