> The brighter that any light shines, the darker the nearby shadows grow.

> Your only obligation is the become the best that you can be in what you are good at. Everything else you should not waste your time with.

> Dreams can breathe life into a man, as well as cage a man. Some dreams are like a storm, sweeping everything in their paths, others are pursued in solitude. Men come and go, live and die by their dreams. And even as the dream is forgotten, it forever smolders deep within a man's heart, waiting to be awoken again.

> Courage is not always rewarded. Nevertheless, remain courageous.
