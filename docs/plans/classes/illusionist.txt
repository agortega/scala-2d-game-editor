# Spells #
##########

Level 1:
--------
=> The illusions that you create are something barely more than mere tricks.

Spark - creates sparks in the vicinity of the illusionist. This can distract some opponents.

Sleight of the Hand - allows the illusionist to trick the unsuspecting opponent and score a critical hit in melee combat. This spell only succeeds if the opponent isn't already attacking the spellcaster. Also, intelligent and perceptive opponents may see through the roose.

Friendlyness - gives the opponents a temporary illusion that the spellcaster is his friend. The illusion ends if the spellcaster attacks any of the opponents. This can lend the caster some time.

Flash - all characters around the spellcaster suffer from a temporary decrease in perception, unless they are quick enough to shield their eyes.

Veiling - hides the spellcaster from his opponents, given that the spellcaster is not too close and the opponents are not too perceptive. If the spellcaster moves, the veiling enchantment stops and he becomes visible again.

Deceptive Throw - throws a missile weapon such as a dagger while in the same time casting a deceptive illusion, making it harder for the target to notice and evade the dagger.

Distract - distracts the target that is casting a spell, causing the spell to fail.


Level 2:
--------
=> Your illusions become more powerful and you feel the magic within them.

Light - illuminates an area around the spellcaster.

Blur - blurs the image of the spellcaster, increasing his defense abilities - the opponents have trouble hitting or shooting the caster.

Firefly - summons a magical firefly and sends it to a location chosen by the illusionist. After reaching this location, the firefly tries to avoid other beings. It can be used to lure a melee opponent away, as long as the caster is careful not to lure the opponent towards himself.

Dispel Apparition - dispels an illusion of level 3 or below, which has to be very close to the caster for this spell to work.

Holy Symbol - summons an image of a holy symbol, which drives most minor undead creatures away.

Optimism - changes the target's perception of the surroundings so that it is less susceptible to fear. A character under the influence of this spell will not panic, run away or suffer fighting performance penalties when overpowered.

Pessimism - changes the target's perception of the surroundings so that it is more susceptible to fear. A character under the influence of this spell is more likely to lose focus, panic or run away.

Kaleidoscope - twists the light around the caster, creating double images. Each time an opponent misses the spellcaster, one of these images disappears. The chance of hitting the spellcaster is inversely proportionate to the number of images surrounding him.

Aura of Vile Visage - creates an aura around an opponent which makes him appear as a vile monster to others, possibly provoking an attack.

Illusion of Vile Visage - dillutes the opponent into thinking that the caster is a vile monster, possibly provoking an attack.

Mirror Shield - creates an illusionary mirror around the caster, protecting him against light-based magic attacks. It additionally reflects these attacks back to their caster.

Eagle Eye - temporarily increases the perception of the character touched by the spellcaster.


Level 3:
--------
=> Your illusions become more powerful and can disable enemies.

Sleight of the Flame - these illusionary flames thrown at the opponent are known to cause him to panic and run if he is weak of will. They may even cause opponents to drop items held in their hands.

Blinding Light - creates a burst of light, temporarily blinding the opponent which is not quick enough to close his eyes for some time.

Firefly Swarm - summons magical fireflies which fly towards the opponent and envelop him, making him less perceptive and less aware of his surroundings. Those under effect will have trouble spotting things in the distance and suffer from decreased defensive abilities.

Greater Blur - blurs the image of the spellcaster heavily, increasing his defense greatly. Critical hits on the spellcaster are much harder to score.

Darkness - conjures a globe of darkness around the spellcaster.

Wall of the Wasp - summons an illusionary wall of violent wasps in front of the caster. Opponents think twice before proceeding through it.

Hypnosis - puts the spellcaster and a nearby non-suspecting target in a state of hypnosis. As long as the spellcaster does not move, cast spells, nor attack, the target cannot move, cast spells or attack. During this time, the target's defenses are lowered.

Sequencer - stores spells that the spellcaster chooses. It can store the level of the spellcaster minus one spell. It gives spellcaster the ability to release these spells one after another, instantly. A caster can have only a single sequencer instance at once.

Cloaking - magically cloaks the spellcaster so that opponents far enough and with a low perception fail to notice him. If the spellcaster attacks or casts a spell at some opponent, then only that opponent will notice him.


Level 4:
--------
=> You are able to create illusions away from your immediate vicinity. Your illusions are able to now affect others much more than yourself.

Serpent Sword - if the characters affected by this spell wield a melee or a long range weapon, they will perceive it as a venomous serpent. Those with either a weak strength of will or without the knowledge that this may be a trick are quick to drop their weapons.

Vile Visages - enchants an area, creating an aura around each character such that it appears as if it were vile monster. This is known to start brawls.

Helmet of the Wasp - an opponent affected by this illusion which wears a helmet will see wasps inside of it. Those weak of will or not knowing this trick throw their helmet away instantly.

Mirror Image - creates a mirror image of the spellcaster which mimics the things he does, but inflicts no damage. The opponents often attack the wrong person, buying the caster some time.

Phantoms - summons illusionary monsters to distract or scare the enemies.

Dispel Illusion - dispels an illusion of level 5 or below.

Deflagration - causes the target location to start burning. The fire is at first small and cannot do harm, but grows quickly and may damage opponents which decide not to move away from it.

Counterimage - enchants the target so that the next illusion of level 5 or below cast by it or cast on it fails.

Spider Boot - sets an illusion of having the target opponent's boots filled with spiders. Opponents weak of will are quick to take off their boots in horror, even if they are in the middle of a combat.

Armor of the Scorpion - gives the target opponent an illusion that his armor is filled with scorpions. Even the strongest are so terrified that they throw away their armor in an instant.


Level 5:
--------
=> You gain more control over illusions, and are able to refine them greatly to serve your purposes.

Striking Resemblance - creates an aura around the illusionist allowing him to take form of another humanoid that is currently in the vicinity.

Invisibility - renders the spellcaster invisible for a limited amount of time.

Magic Warding - illusions are less likely to succeed in the area enchanted by this spell.

Backfire - enchants a target so that the next magic cast by it is turned into an explosion.

Electrification - channels the static electricity in the environment onto the target, causing it to drop metal weapons and take damage proportionate to the number of equipped metallic items.

Counterspell - enchants the target so that any next spell of level 6 or below cast by it or cast on it fails.

Interference - twists the images around a target opponent so that he is unable to perceive his surroundings correctly. Those under effect of this illusion see things around them at wrong places, confusing them greatly. Less perceptive opponents are particularly vulnerable to this spell.

Local Scrying - allows the spellcaster to temporarily view what is happening on some other location in the same area.


Level 6:
--------
=> You begin to understand that there is no boundary between the illusion and reality, and gain more insight into the true nature of illusions. You start to comprehend that an object without an observer does not truly exist.

Flame of Undril
Origin: Little is known about where the scroll for this spell originated. Some say that a mage Undril living as a hermit in the mountains near the volcanos far north learned it by watching a fire elemental that used to invoke it for some reason. He first wrote the spell down with coal on stones near his establishment. It is now one of the favoured spells among the mages in the north.
Description: Envelops an opponent with flames that feel very real. The opponent suffers fire damage until the flames dissipate.

Ring of Undril
Origin: It is said that the hermit mage Undril learned this spell by following and observing fire elementals laying waste to lands in the north. Later, Undril had apprentices which spread knowledge of the spell throughout the lands.
Description: Enchants an area in a ring of fire. Opponents that choose to remain within the ring will suffer continuous fire damage.

Globe of Kariim
Origin: Long ago, in the harsh deserts in the south fierce warriors ruled the lands at this time and wizardry was perceived as nothing more than a mockery done for the amusement of the crowds at town centers. The heads of the warrior caste were well aware that the only way to prolong their rulership was to ban wizardry and wizard guilds. This lasted until a wizard known as Kariim invented a powerful spell which protected him from the warriors. It is said that he could create an impervious globe around himself that no sword could break. He shared his spell with other wizards of the lands and they forged an alliance against the tyranny of the warriors. Wizard schools and guilds were formed throughout the lands, and balance between might and magic was once again regained. Kariim enjoys great respect today among the wizards of the south.
Decription: Creates an impenetrable globe around the caster, greatly increasing his protection value.

Paralysis
Origin: Its origins unknown to most, this spell was forbidden by the Great Count Gerald who declared it a form of necromancy, although he was no wizard himself. This was probably done due to the fact that illusionists used it far too often to fulfill their own goals. In any case, the use of it is forbidden under penalty of death and any master illusionists today will, when asked, claim that he knows it not, though such ignorance is less than likely.
Description: Renders an opponent paralyzed.

Ganilot's Persuasion
Origin: The story of the first use of this spell is well known among illusionists of the lands. A young king's wife succumbed to a disease, leaving him in depression and despair. When he refused to lead his armies to defend the kingdom against a barbarian attack, a wizard by the name of Ganilot created an illusion so real that the young king believed that his wife somehow came back to life. The illusion lasted long enough for the king to be persuaded to lead his defending armies. Fearing his king's retribution once he'd find out about the truth, the wizard Ganilot fled the kingdom never to return. This spell has only later been used by illusionists of a less benevolent disposition to cause mischief and grief.
Description: All summoned creature illusions become real for a brief period of time, thus being able to inflict damage and cast spells.

Rhea's Light
Origin: Great wizardess Rhea devised this spell as part of her acceptance test for the wizard's guild, thus showing a high level of brilliance for her young age.
Description: Creates a ray of light so strong that it causes physical damage to the target.

Coupled Teleswitch
Origin: Neglected by many mages and generally regarded to have little use, this spell is said to have been devised by Urdevii enchanters.
Description: Exchanges the locations of the caster and the target. After several seconds it exchanges their locations again.

Teleport
Origin: One of the oldest known higher illusions, the origin of this spell is not well documented.
Description: Teleports the spellcaster to a target location in the proximity of the spellcaster.

Teleswitch
Origin: Wizards of the south devised this spell to lure enemy warriors onto seemingly helpless and trapped allies. They would then exchange their locations, thus trapping the enemy. This tactic is practiced to perfection in the south and is favoured among battle mages.
Description: Teleports the spellcaster to the location of the spell target. In turn, the target is teleported at the previous location of the spellcaster.

Dispel Magic
Origin: Mages in ancient times were known to put a great number of protective enchantments on themselves to avoid being obliterated by warriors or other mages. It is said that some of the mages were nearly invincible due to this, and it was not until a group of wandering wizards from the east brought knowledge about a powerful dispel magic that such a protective tactic lost its strength.
Description: Dispels all enchantments of level 7 or below in the target area.

Spatial Binding
Origin: Devised long ago to prevent teleportation, this spell was adopted by the wizards of the south to prevent getting themselves teleported into a trap.
Description: Enchants the target area so that no teleport, dimension door, gate or any similar spell can succeed.

Entanglement
Origin: This spell probably originated among the spider-worshippers living in the mountains in the north.
Description: Envelops the target in a sticky web, thus immobilizing it for some time. The opponent can still attack or cast spells.

Holy Voice
Origin: This spell was probably first used by a sect of wandering priests from the north. One of their deflecting priests is said to have became a wizard who wrote the scroll for this spell down.
Description: Enchants the area with a source of a trembling voice for a limited amount of time. Causes damage to nearby minor undead. Causes major undead to panic.


Level 7
-------
=> Your ability to alter the reality around you becomes much more powerful.

Dimension Door
Origin: It is said that this spell was devised by the monks living in the mountains in the north to avoid going through dangerous and unfriendly wilderness to reach other monasteries.
Description: Transports the spellcaster and creatures in his vicinity to other areas, possibly far away. The range is determined by the spellcaster's level and his attunement to magical energies. The dimension door can only be created in open areas and the target location may not be very accurate.

Greater Warding
Origin: Master mages employed by the rulers of the land often use this spell to protect the royal treasury or valuable artifacts and magic items from thieving hands.
Description: Creates an impenetrable barrier. This enchantment lasts permanently and can only be removed by the spellcaster passing through it or his death. A more powerful form of a dispel may also be enough to remove the barrier.

Reflection Globe
Origin: An apprentice of Kariim is said to have devised this spell. When wizards started gaining advantage over the warriors in the south, they started turning against each other. This globe not only protected the caster, but turned the spells back against the attacking wizard.
Description: Creates a globe around the caster such that any level 5 spell cast on him by others is reflected back at the source.

Antimagic
Origin: The history of this spell is not exactly known, but its uses have been recorded and known to historians for at least three centuries. Some claim it was given to humans as a gift from the avenfolk when the realm had to be defended against an invasion of vile creatures.
Description: Enchants the area so that no spell of level 7 or below subsequently cast succeeds. All existing enchantments are dispelled, regardless of their level.

Tracking Sword
Origin: A subtle method of performing assassinations of various lords and military leaders, this spell has been utilized by some wizards to serve their intents since fifty years ago when it was devised. It is said that an assassination attempt was made on the Great Count Gerald once, but he was nimble enough to avoid the sword and get away with merely a scar. He used the same sword to slit the throat of the very same wizard who cast the spell on him.
Description: Animates a target melee weapon so that it starts attacking the enemies of the spellcaster.

Fireburst
Origin: Coming in far too many forms and variations to bear a clear origin, this destructive spell is preferred weapon in the arsenal of most master battle mages that fight alone. Those fighting in groups can endanger their friends with this spell, so they usually avoid it.
Description: Releases a circular burst of flames around the caster which explodes violently, consuming anything in its path.

Energy Ray
Origin: It is said that this spell was devised by illusionist master mages working together with a now lost sect of solitary wizards that lived in monasteries high in the mountains. While these solitary wizards drew their magical power from the skies themselves and were thus able to tap into enormous amounts of energy from the sun, the illusionists were versed in working with the light and focusing it.
Description: Releases a highly concentrated ray of light at the target, causing massive damage. This spell is much more effective when cast in open areas, during daylight.


Level 8
-------
=> You gain the ability to make your illusions permanent, thus being able to transform yourself and your surroundings.

Spell Shear
Origin: A refined and more powerful cousin of the simple counterspell, this ancient spell is cast only by the mages who achieved the highest levels of the Art.
Description: Removes all enchantments in the area where it is cast, regardless of their level. If the target is another spellcaster currently casting a spell, his spellcasting will fail, unless he is also casting the Spell Shear. Furthermore, while the spell takes effect, he will not be able to cast any spell other than Spell Shear.

Bear Transformation
Origin: While the druids of the lands usually oppose using it, this spell was neither conceived by them nor does it have any resemblance to their magic. Transformation spells are well kept and guarded in libraries throughout the lands, and masters of the art guard guard their transformation scrolls and spellbooks well. Not that anyone less than a master would understand it anyway...
Description: Transforms the caster into a bear permanently, giving him supreme strength and toughness. All items are dropped and cannot be carried.

Wolf Transformation
Origin: This transformation was conceived by one of the wizards searching for lycanthropy enchantments. Some claim he was successful in his lycanthropy quest, thus ironically being unable to claim the authorship for the wolf transformation spell.
Description: Transforms the caster into a wolf permanently, giving him supreme speed and agility, and equipping him with deadly fangs. All items are dropped and cannot be carried.

Inverse Transformation
Origin: Although it exists far too long to remember when and where it was first used (even if there was a single place), wise men agree that this is the most useful transformation spell of all. Wizards achieving this level of prowess are advised to learn the inverse transformation spell before learning any other transformation. Only fools ignore this advice.
Description: Transforms the caster into his original form. This spell can be cast even if the spellcaster was transformed into a form that cannot normally cast spells.

Boar Transformation
Origin: Conceived by the old illusionist masters, this spell is different in nature than the transformation magic used by druids, which shun its use. It's equally deadly nonetheless.
Description: Transforms the caster into a wild boar, giving him great speed and agility, toughness to match and a set of deadly fangs. Wild boars can go berserk when in fight, becoming much more deadly. All items are dropped and cannot be carried.

Urdevii Transformation
Origin: Now kept in utmost secrecy by the dogfolk, this spell was once created in order to enter their ranks and learn of their secrets. After a great conflict between the Urdevii and a human kingdom in which the spell was devised, all scrolls with this spell were taken by the Urdevii mages and hidden well. The mages that devised the spell were executed.
Description: Transforms the caster into an Urdevii.

Power Equilibrium
Origin: It's said that the wizard Kariim was exhausted after one of the battles and a traitor in his ranks decided to take advantage of this. He attempted to cast a swarm of magic missiles at the master. To his surprise, Kariim expertly stole some of his mana using a spell he previously devised and then created a reflective mantle to repel the missiles back.
Description: Exchanges mana with the target character so that their mana levels become equal. Mana above the maximum mana level is always lost in this exchange.

Sprite Transformation
Origin: A wizard is said to have followed and studied a pack of sprites living in a huge forest, and learned enough about them to devise this spell. After producing the scroll, he disappeared mysteriously, and was never heard from again. Some claim he transformed himself into a sprite, and spent the rest of his days living with his new kin.
Description: Transforms the caster into a sprite, trading toughness for great speed and agility. Sprites have the teleport ability, and can use it as much as they want.

Spell Shield
Origin: Often used by the great wizard Kariim to shield himself from other wizards that worked behind his back, the origin of this protection spell is suspected to actually have been devised by the Urdevii long before and gifted to Kariim by them as a sign of trust and friendship.
Description: Creates a powerful shield around the target which guards him against any spell of level 6 or below being cast upon him.
