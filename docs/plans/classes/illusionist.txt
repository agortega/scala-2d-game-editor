Level 1:

Sleight of the Flame - these illusionary flames are known to cause those weak of will to panic and run. They may even cause characters to drop items held in their hands.


Level 2:

Serpent Sword - if the characters affected by the spell wield a melee weapon, they will perceive it as a venomous serpent. Those with either a weak strength of will or without the knowledge that this may be a trick usually drop the weapon instantly.
